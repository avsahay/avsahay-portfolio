__Context:__ To limit the scope of the project for this class, I reduced the data set from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) to focus solely on superhero films released after 2000, which provided me 128 data points for analysis. While I am using Google Slides as a storyboarding tool, the final project will be built in Shorthand.

__Set Up:__ First, I will define what constitutes a superhero movie to provide context. I am sure most audiences would be familiar with DC or Marvel Comics based movies like _The Dark Knight_ or _Iron Man_ trilogy, but for this presentation, I am considering all movies that feature or centralize around a figure with extraordinary powers/abilities. After showing the general increase in superhero movies, I will show the impact from a business perspective by introducing revenue figures and which companies are profiting. These visualizations should strengthen the importance of this issue: superhero movies are fun, but they are also a popular choice for production companies because they make so much money. 

__Conflict:__ It is easy to assume that this issue is not particularly important or frivolous. The next section is designed to show the real life impact of "reel life". After discussing with people in class, I think it is better to speak to target demographics instead of relying on data visualizations that may rely on stereotypical depictions of demographics. I tested word clouds, but they seemed too busy. I will highlight the interests that are represented by movies and show the gender disparity in cast and direction. This is especially an issue given how much money goes into these productions, which affects people's livelihoods. 

__Resolution:__ Having shown why the proliferation of superhero movies is more than a cultural moment, I will end with a call to action for two different audiences. The first would be a general audience - someone who knows about superhero movies and has likely seen at least a few, regardless of their feelings towards them. I call them to consider more critically what movies they buy tickets for as their choice has deeper impact than they may realize. The second is an entertainment-savvy audience - someone who is educated through academia or practice about the movie industry and understands the business. I call them to advocate for investment in other genres. The calls to action feed into each other: audiences buying tickets for other genres of movies encourages investment in them, resulting in more variety of movies for audiences.
