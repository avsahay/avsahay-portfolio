__Context:__ To limit the scope of the project for this class, I reduced the data set from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) to focus solely on superhero films released after 2000, which provided me [128 data points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yEphC6aMIq_Fq_UDiWkWj46SEul6wLHocYowYDP2Luo/edit?usp=sharing) for analysis. While I am using Google Slides as a storyboarding tool, the final project will be built in Shorthand.

__Set Up:__ First, I will define what constitutes a superhero movie to provide context. I am sure most audiences would be familiar with DC or Marvel Comics based movies like _The Dark Knight_ or _Iron Man_ trilogy, but for this presentation, I am considering all movies that feature or centralize around a figure with extraordinary powers/abilities. After showing the general increase in superhero movies, I will show the impact from a business perspective by introducing revenue figures and which companies are profiting. These visualizations should strengthen the importance of this issue: superhero movies are fun, but they are also a popular choice for production companies because they make so much money. 

__Conflict:__ It is easy to assume that this issue is not particularly important or frivolous. The next section is designed to show the real life impact of "reel life". After discussing with people in class, I think it is better to speak to target demographics instead of relying on data visualizations that may rely on stereotypical depictions of demographics. I tested word clouds, but they seemed too busy. I will highlight the interests that are represented by movies and show the gender disparity in cast and direction. This is especially an issue given how much money goes into these productions, which affects people's livelihoods. 

__Resolution:__ Having shown why the proliferation of superhero movies is more than a cultural moment, I will end with a call to action for two different audiences. The first would be a general audience - someone who knows about superhero movies and has likely seen at least a few, regardless of their feelings towards them. I call them to consider more critically what movies they buy tickets for as their choice has deeper impact than they may realize. The second is an entertainment-savvy audience - someone who is educated through academia or practice about the movie industry and understands the business. I call them to advocate for investment in other genres. The calls to action feed into each other: audiences buying tickets for other genres of movies encourages investment in them, resulting in more variety of movies for audiences.

__Visualization 1:__ I decided to use a line graph to show change over time. I tried a couple quick calculations to see if I could smooth the jagged drops and heights a bit, but they didn't seem to reflect as accurately the changes from year to year. I decided a trendline would help illustrate the general point that superhero movies are increasing. At first glance, it does not seem too significant.

__Visualization 2:__ This graph shows the impact of those few movies. Since I am showing revenue by year, I chose an area graph to give the viewer a sense of accumulation. The y axis is labeled to highlight that this graph is showing _billions_ of dollars of profit. It draws the eye to the larger 'mountains of cash' as indicated by my use of green in more recent years (Lecture 2, TSWD). In short, superhero movies = LOTS of money. 

__Visualization 3:__ As it turns out, Walt Disney Pictures has made the most revenue off of superhero movies. I chose to sort the horizontal bars in ascending order to force the viewer's eye to travel past the many companies Walt Disney surpasses. I maintain a consistent visual vocabulary by using the same shade of green to represent money again (Lecture 2, TSWD). Again, I keep the axis label to highlight the fact that these companies are making profit in the range of billions of dollars.

__Visualization 4:__ I decided to use a histogram to show how many actresses were among the top four billed cast for superhero movies. When I was first organizaing the data, I had planned to only use the top three billed cast as a measure for gender representation. Unfortunately, when I did so, it resulted in much fewer movies with _any_ women in the lead. To account for measures in IMdB's algorithim with mehcanisms for measuring top billed rankings I don't understand, I decided to use the top four. Still, it is not a very good sign given how the curve tapers off. 

__Visualization 5:__ I originally considered making this visualization a simple statistic. However, I decided on the pie chart because it evokes a sense of female perspectives being swallowed by the male perspective. I used the same color to count women as before. 

__Visualization 6:__ In my call to action, I want to draw attention to the reciprocal relationship between audiences spending their money on movies intentionally and production companies investing in movies that are gaining audiences, so I will be using iconography to show the relationship to support my words during my presentation.

# the user research: protocol

__Target Audience__

1. General Public - As briefly mentioned earlier, one of my call to actions, and thus the presentation, is directed towards the general public. This audience is likely familiar with superhero movies and has seen at least one. They may or may not like it, but that is less relevant. More importantly, they likely have not critically about the impact of superhero movies and see it as a trend.
2. Entertainment Professionals - The other audience of my presentation are entertainment professionals who work in the industry and may have some degree of power in the production process. They likely know how much money is being made from superhero movies, and even which companies are profiting most. However, they may not have considered the gender disparity being reflected in the business. 

To cover these potential interests and backgrounds of my target audience, I decided to three people with varying degrees of movie interest. I knew I had access to students studying entertainment who would have some knowledge of the business and likely seen several superhero movies. I also approached someone I knew did not care for superhero movies but had seen a few. 
- _User A_: Man, Graduate Student, Mid-20's, Studying Entertainment Industry Management. Watches Marvel movies. 
- _User B_: Woman, Dental Hygenist, Mid-50's, Does not like superhero movies, has seen some.
- _User C_: Man, Game Developer, Early-20's, Watches Marvel and DC movies _and_ TV shows. 

__Interview Questions__

_Objective I_: Understand if the importance of the issue is communicated.
> What do you think is important about this topic? Is it important?

_Objective II_: Ensure the data visualizations make sense.
> What did you think of the data visualizations? Was one easier to read? Was one more difficult to read?

_Objective III_: Check if visualizations support message.
> Why do you think this visualization was used? Did it work?

_Objective IV_: See if call to action is effective.
> At the end of the presentation, what were your first thoughts?

# the user research: findings

| Feedback | User A | User B | User C | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Objective I | Superhero movies are such high budget productions, and ultimately, companies have a budget each year. "If money is being spent on superhero movies, it isn't being spent on other, diverse, unique movies." Didn't realize gender disparity in directors was so bad.  | Didn't think topic would be important. Had not noticed the gender disparity, but she could see it in retrospect.| Thinks it is important. However, isn't certain the issue is specific to superhero genre. | 
| Objective II | Visualization 3 was not dramatic enough. Had a little difficulty understanding Visualization 4. Didn't understand what horizontal axis was. Design-wise it also seemed too different and vertical from other visualizations. Same with Visualization 5 - felt the pie chart felt "too calm for how shocking the stat is. Maybe it's the color scheme?" Visualization 6 would be confusing without explanation. | Trendline in Visualization 1 made the title seem "hyperbolic." Visualization 2 was more impressive because of the vertical axis units, surprised her. Visualization 3 was hard to read, text was too close together. Didn't understand horizontal axis in Visualization 4 without explanation. Colors too similar in Visualization 5. Visualization 6 was also difficult to understand without explanation.  | Visualizations were mostly easy to read. Visualization 4 needed label for horizontal access. Formatting of Visualization 5 was off - why was there a gray bar for the total number of directors? Liked dark color background, should use more consistently with chart colors too. | 
| Objective III | The visualizations used generally made sense with context provided from me while speaking. Isn't sure it'd be as easy to understand to the average viewer. | Visualizations 4 and 6 were hard to understand without explanation. Generally supported message, except Visualization 1 made it seem more like "a superhero creep instead of invasion." | Generally supported the message, but didn't necessarily seem like an issue limited to superhero movies. Were there other statistics for female directors in other genres? Had I considered race? | 
| Objective IV | "This makes me feel better about spending too much money at indie theaters watching more niche movies." | She wants to use this to convince her family not to see superhero movies because she finds them boring anyway. | Geniunely enjoys superhero movies so he's probably still going to spend money on them. | 

__Key Insights__

1. The topic is engaging! Even for those who were uninterested in superhero movies, the impact of the genre was interesting to see. 
2. The color scheme needs to be more dramatic to highlight some of my points, narratively. In the final project, definitely want consistent color scheme. 
3. The histogram was difficult to understand without a label in the horizontal axis.
4. The call to action seems somewhat successful - User A reaffirmed the action they were already doing, and User B was encouraged to inform others and advocate for the action. Technically, User C is also thinking critically, even if it did not result in my desired outcome.

__Proposed Changes__

| Feedback | Change | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visualization 4 is hard to understand. | Add a label to the horizontal axis. I had actually struggled with this in Tableau, so as a last resort I can use image editing to impose a label. | High |
| Colors were too calm/not dramatic enough. | Choose and apply a dramatic color scheme. Bold colors, inspired by comic books and popular superhero costume colors (black, red, blue, yellow). | High | 
| Visualization 3 was difficult to read. | Reduce data points (group minor production companies as "Other") and use gray and colors to show how far ahead Disney is. | Medium |
| Visualization 5 has unnecessary information and does not live up to the story. | Remove legend and label in some other way. Use more dramatic colors. | Medium |
| Visualization 6 is hard to understand without explanation. | Instead of just iconography, I'll try using Infogram to create a diagram for the call to action. | Low |
