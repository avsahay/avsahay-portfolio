To limit the scope of the project for this class, I reduced the data set from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) to focus solely on superhero films released after 2000, which provided me 128 data points for analysis. While I am using Google Slides as a storyboarding tool, the final project will be built in Shorthand.

__Set Up:__ First, I will define what constitutes a superhero movie to provide context. I am sure most audiences would be familiar with DC or Marvel Comics based movies like _The Dark Knight_ or _Iron Man_ trilogy, but for this presentation, I am considering all movies that feature or centralize around a figure with extraordinary powers/abilities. After showing the general increase in superhero movies, I will show the impact from a business perspective by introducing revenue figures and which companies are profiting. These visualizations should strengthen the importance of this issue: superhero movies are fun, but they are also a popular choice for production companies because they make so much money. 

__Conflict:__
