- [Data Set 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data): This data set is publically accessible on Kaggle and compiled by a company called PromptCloud. It contains 1000 records of the top 100 English Language films each year from 2006 to 2016 as sourced from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). The dataset contains more information than I anticipate needing, but the key measures are the film title, genres, year of release, and revenue in millions. I will be editing the genre column to indicate which movies are superhero films. For the purposes of this project, I will be using movies produced in conjunction with a comic book company (Marvel, DC, Darkhorse, etc.). 
- [Data Set 2](https://datasets.imdbws.com/): Unfortunately, the previous data set only goes through 2016. For the message I am trying to tell, which incorporates the impact of COVID-19, I need the top 100 English Language Films each year from 2017 to 2022 as well. This will add an additional 500 records to my total dataset. I will need to supplement this data myself by filtering for the appropriate measures from the original IMdB source. This data set is updated daily, but since I don't need any data from this year, it does not matter when I download it.

I've designed a task list with deadlines to complete the project and be ready for presentation on February 29.
