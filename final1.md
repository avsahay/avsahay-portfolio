# the final project: part 1

# the outline.
For the final project, I want to tell a story about the impact of superhero films on the production and theatrical releases of other kinds of films. The entertainment industry has been going through many changes, particularly with regards to releases in cinema. Superhero movie releases have become social occasions that people must plan to attend for fear of having not only the released film's story spoiled, but all the additional properties and sequels that are now linked to each film. Franchises have existed before, but superhero movies seem to come out with shorter and shorter intervals between. By supplmenting the content with televisoin shows as well, superher movies have become an cultural entertainment staple. 

Despite the popularity of the genre, industry professionals have started critiquing the impact of the proliferation of superhero content in film and tv. Reknowned directors like Martin Scorcese and Francis Ford Coppola denounce Marvel films in particular, deriding their artistic value. I want to examine whether the wave of critique against superhero films holds merit. While art is subjective, revenue and production numbers are not. A time analysis could show whether other genres of films are no longer being produced to the same degrees, and total revenue by genere can be calculated as well.  

__Set Up -__
The context will be the rise of superhero films in this century (almost). Since the birth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the late 00's and Christopher Nolan's foray into the world of Batman, the superhero genre has been rebranded from a niche market to absolute mainstream. But what impact does this have on the overall film industry? 

__Conflict -__
The conflict would be the reduced title releases in other genres. Not everyone may understand why this is a bad thing. Films are indicative of cultural moments, so there is artistic value being lost when other kinds of films aren't made. However, the industry is also a business, so this pattern can also reflect what corporations or creative professionals (directors, actors, etc.) are gaining increased profits. Thus I want to share the revenue numbers for these films as well. 

__Resolution -__
This issue is obviously mediated by the consequences of COVID-19 which affected the number of films made and subsequently how many were released in theaters. 

__Ask -__
By now, I should have successfully shown the deep impact of consumer choices on the direction of the film industry, and the impact of superhero films in particular. I think asking people to reduce the number of superhero films they watch in theater is unrealistic. They are simply too much a part of current culture to withdraw from. However, it is reasonable to ask people to think critically about which movies they buy tickets for and whether it may be worth choosing to Netflix and Chill instead.

# the sketches.
![Final Sketches](FinalProjectSketch.png)
1. __Set Up -__ I haven't decided between proportional charts or line trends. While the line trends will show a great history of how the number of certain genre films has changed. However, the proportional chart may make a better story for showing the growing share of superhero films. 
2. __Conflict -__ I'm hoping to highlight the severe increase in superhero films with a more artistic graph that conveys the appeal of the superhero genre before sharing facts about which genres have fewer theatrical releases. In particular, I want to draw attention to the audiences who are no longer considered perhaps as demographically profitable and the cast/crew who may longer have as productive careers. I think a table showing total revenue by genre may be the simplest way of communicating the financial disparity. 
3. __Resolution -__ It is impossible to discuss the entertainment industry and theatrical release without considering COVID-19 so I do need to mention it and show its impact on the theatrical releases and what a potential return to normal looks like now. A proportional chart may be good for consistency, but because the number of films released in pandemic years were so low, it is likely better to use pie charts with the size of the circle reflecting the volume of films released to convey both absolute and relative quantities. In order to maintain my point however, I want to reveal that depsite reduced theater releases, the amount of money being invested in superhero films is very significant. 
4. __Ask -__ The ask here is somewhat simple so I want to use one more visualization to show briefly the impact of the audience's choices in something as innocuous as a movie ticket. This will support my ask to consider more deeply which films people watch in theater if they want to see more than superhero films in the future.

# the data.

- [Data Set 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data): This data set is publically accessible on Kaggle and compiled by a company called PromptCloud. It contains 1000 records of the top 100 English Language films each year from 2006 to 2016 as sourced from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). The dataset contains more information than I anticipate needing, but the key measures are the film title, genres, year of release, and revenue in millions. I will be editing the genre column to indicate which movies are superhero films. In addition, for simplicity, even though the data set allows films to be tagged up to three genres, I will only be using the first tag for categorization purposes. For the purposes of this project, I will be using movies produced in conjunction with a comic book company (Marvel, DC, Darkhorse, etc.). 
- [Data Set 2](https://datasets.imdbws.com/): Unfortunately, the previous data set only goes through 2016. For the message I am trying to tell, which incorporates the impact of COVID-19, I need the top 100 English Language Films each year from 2017 to 2022 as well. This will add an additional 500 records to my total dataset. I will need to supplement this data myself by filtering for the appropriate measures from the original IMdB source. This data set is updated daily, but since I don't need any data from this year, it does not matter when I download it.

# the method and medium.
My presentation will be shared via Shorthand. I plan to conduct any additional user research over this upcoming weekend so I have ample time for edits and possibly create additional visualizations if needed. I've designed a task list with deadlines to complete the project and be ready for presentation on February 29. 

| Task | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| Clean Data | 2/15 | 
| Create Wire Frames | 2/17 | 
| Create Storyboards | 2/18 |
| User Research | 2/19 | 
| Edit/Update Visualizations | 2/21 | 
| Build in Shorthand | 2/25 | 
| Practice Presentation | 2/28 |
