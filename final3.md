__Edits__

After Part II, I built out the story in Shorthand, using my Google Slides storyboard as a basis for sectioning. One useful piece of feedback I got was that some of the more shocking facts weren't dramatic enough for the story due to the relatively calm color scheme. I was using more conventional colors, rather than something that matched the story I was telling. So for that reason, instead of using convention like using green for visualizations regarding money, I switched to an entirely stylized palette. My Superhero palette is based on popular colors in superhero costumes: Black, Red, Yellow, and Blue. I used blue for the data visualizations to create a dramatic background against the black for the story, and used red for highlights. 

In addition, the feedback really helped coalesce the target audience of my story - I think sharing with a general audience was too generic, and the pop-vibe is meant more for an audience that has more decisionmaking power. I decided that my story fit better for a TedTalk style at a media conference for emerging professionals in the field. These would be people who are not in charge yet, but will one day be in the position to make choices about what productions to greenlight. A presentation like this will make them conscious about their small choices now, which ideally will snowball to their bigger choices in the future.

Another really useful piece of insight I received, was that the title of the presentation didn't match the story I was telling. The title was originally "The Superhero Invasion" which was very strong. However, the first data visualization shows a trend line that was not very drastic. The user specifically called it a "creep" which reminded me of the definition of power creep which created a better narrative as it described the slow increase in superhero movies which results in a larger impact than expected. Using that dynamic created a better story that matched the arc of the data visualziations I intended to show, since the later visualziations (2 - 5) were more dramatic. 

__In-Class Presentation__

Something I did not realize was important to higlight was some of the key statistics that emphasized the impact of superhero movies - the return on investment statistic is particularly impressive. To account for these, I decided to enlarge their font in the presentation to highlight these key pieces of information. 

__Future Improvements__

With more time, I would like to do additional data visualizations on other genres to further prove my point. I was only able to include a table showing a general trend of target audiences, but with more resources I could do a similar analysis regarding gender ratios in cast and crew to show how money is not transferring to certain demographics. My original concept of using more data from IMDb would allow me to better demonstrate the impact of the superhero movies on other genres, which would be stronger for my call to action.  

Also, I belatedly realized that the embed in the Github page changes the coloring slightly, so I would experiment and refine my color palette to make it accessible.
