# method and medium
My presentation will be shared via Shorthand. I plan to conduct my user research over this upcoming weekend so I have ample time for edits and possibly create additional visualizations if needed. I've designed a task list with deadlines to complete the project and be ready for presentation on February 29. 

| Task | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| Clean Data | 02/15 | 
| Create Wire Frames | 2/17 | 
| Create Storyboards | 2/18 |
| User Research | 2/19 | 
| Edit/Update Visualizations | 2/21 | 
| Build in Shorthand | 2/25 | 
| Practice Presentation | 2/28 |
