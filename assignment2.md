# part 4: A Summary
The differences between the OECD visualization (part 1) and the Flourish Walk Through (part 2) are significant. 

The OECD visualization uses the preattentive attribute of color/hue to draw the viewer's eye to the average OECD Debt to GDP Ratio. By sorting from least to greatest, it also shows a clear narrative about Japan's high debt. It is a little difficult to immediately tell what the y-axis is measuring due to the light color of the subtitle. While this chart may be useful for a brief, 3-second snapshot of debt by country, it isn't necessarily as nuanced for someone curious about how the debt values were measured. 

The Flourish Walk Through creates a sparkline visualization that can seem a little overwhelming at first, but does a cool job of showing change over time across different countries. It becomes easier to recognize when there were dramatic increases or decreases in debt, as well as identify general trends in time. However, it is difficult to compare the countries to each other by Debt to GDP Ratio if they are not in the same row. For my visualization, I made some key choices:
- I included a pop-up for audiences who were curious about exact number values. 
- I specified the timeline of the data in the title, as it did not exactly match the hashmark labels of the x-axis. 
- I used a larger sized subtitle to clarify the units of the y-axis and clear any confusion of what the 3 letter abbreviations represented.
- I kept colors to a minimum to avoid charts competing for attention and used red to represent debt, following conventions around money and color.
